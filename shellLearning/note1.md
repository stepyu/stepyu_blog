#  my first note of learning shell
1.	exit is different from return 
 exit is to exit the whole process
 return just return the value and end the function
2.	1>/dev/null 2>$1 means let the print out message to a device, which is not exist in fact.
3.	Source command is the same meaning with . command  it can execute shell file ,and it can make the file effective immediately 
4.	&& symbol make the shell commands together ,which command can execute one by one in the case of the ahead command is execute successfully.
